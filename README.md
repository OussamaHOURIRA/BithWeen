Visualisation des Crypto-monnaies 

Investment in the CAC40 or the S & P500 does not exceed an annual profitability of 10% ! Are you impatient and want to go elsewhere?
Welcome to our cryptocurrency visualization platform.

You'll find in a detailed and comparative cryptocurrency visualization to guide your investment choices (Portfolio Management) :

- Cryptocurrencies Treemap in terms of capitalization by highlighting the variation by chosen period of time
- Multiple Line Chart display of the value of the chosen Coin (expressed in dollars) with possibility to choose the scale of the time that suits us (display month-15 days-week). The curve is displayed dynamically with synchronization with the previous Treemap.
- Multiple Line Chart to compare the chosen Coin with other market values (Commodities / Currencies). We highlight the profitability and the volatility (risk) of the values displayed to help the investor in his choices.

# Context
- We have chosen to present the different cryptocurrencies because they are very different from each other, although they do not all have a physical basis. Indeed, Bitcoin is known for its specularity due to the brutal confrontation between supply and demand. The applications of Bitcoin are weak compared to Etherium which remains the best digital currency in terms of attractiveness for developers since it has many applications in different industries.
Lately, many private or state banks have decided to invest in cryptocurrencies because of the huge cash flow (transactions) that occur every day or even every minute. The return on investment in cryptocurrency was just amazing. Many people have made money, others have lost their capital, that is the law of the market.
- The investment in cryptocurrency is very complicated even for the big traders worldwide because it is based on BlockChain technology that is under development. There are even those who say that the emergence of Bitcoin was "premature".
Which says lack of control, says possibility of exploiting the field of investment by many actors in particular those which have no knowledge in Trading (Indicators Bollingers, MACD, Charitism ...).
Indeed, it is enough to understand the global principle of the exchanges of financial assets in particular the stress of the market (balance supply and demand) in order to take the right decision. Risk is very present in this type of investment, which justifies the high risk premium or the return on investment in the digital currency market.

- So, we understand that the investment is mainly based on two aspects: the psychic linked to the risk aversion of the investor lambda. The other is based on the understanding of some simple and simple indicators: Profitability per unit of time and the volatility of the financial asset (the standard deviation of the value distribution over time of the currency in question).

 # Identification of the need and the potential market
- We  have noticed through the analysis made previously that the market includes potential investors who do not have advanced knowledge in the field of Trading (which therefore makes investment very ambiguous for them, and it is this ambiguity that generates worry, increases their stress and therefore affects their risk aversion).
 
- There is therefore a niche market that needs to intuitively understand the fundamentals of investment in cryptocurrency so as not to let this opportunity miss.

- So we decided to set up an intuitive dashboard summarizing some essential aspects to know before embarking on this adventure:

. The popularity: based on the capitalization of each digital currency, more than the currency is popular, more than if one tries to sell, there is less and less the risk that one can not find a stakeholder ( or buyer).

. Profitability: This corresponds to a historical comparison of value prices in order to identify trends in the digital currency in question. Profitability is relatively relative to the old values ​​but must also be comparable with other financial assets (Currencies & Commodities) known for their low volatility.

. Volatility: based on the standard deviation of the value share distribution, ie describes how old value quotes are distributed over time. This notion is therefore linked to the risk and stress of the stock market.

- Note: During the course of our project, we have ensured that the different values ​​displayed are standardized in order to be comparable (eliminate the effect of scale due to the difference between the prices of financial assets).
