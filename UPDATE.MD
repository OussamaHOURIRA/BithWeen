The requested changes for the project :


- Centering the profitability graph in Y0 and highlight the y = 0 axis: 

It is done, the Y=0 axis is highlighted (because the profitability is always compared with the reference Y0).

- Adjust the third div (% RSD ..): 

The presentation is more refined, the information displayed is better presented and more comprehensible.

- Other changes (as discussed at the end of the presentation):

We can notice that all elements of the dashboard has become responsive, the major updates were on the treemap which now has become an SVG (the old treemap version was based on DIV).

- We still be opened for any suggestions or remarks that can help improve our project... 

Thanks for your prompt feedback.
